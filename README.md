![default view](./assets/img/Default-Screen.png)

Upon clicking the generate password button you will be given this prompt

![password length prompt](./assets/img/passWordLength.png)

Once you input your desire password length you will get 4 prompts asking which character sets you want included in possible pieces of the password

![Character List select prompt](./assets/img/char-list-select.png)

Assuming the password length was valid and at least one character list was selected, the password would then display in the box.

You can then click the button again to generate another password, this will remove the previously generated one from the screen.
